## About The Project

This project is a simple raytracer written in C. It is a part of the 42 school curriculum. The goal of this project is to learn about raytracing and to create a simple raytracer.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [MinilibX](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html)
- [Libft](https://github.com/josiaskas/libft)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo, with submodules (libft)
```sh
    git clone --recurse-submodules
```

- The submodules are needed to compile the project, if you forgot to clone with submodules, you can use the following command:
    ```sh
        git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```
    Also miniLibX is needed to compile the project, there is a builded version of the library in the repository, but if you want to build it yourself, you can use the following command:
    ```sh
        make -C minilibx
    ```

2. Compile the project
```sh
    make
```
Note: If you want to compile the project with the bonus, you can use the following command:
```sh
    make bonus
```

### Usage

1. Run the program
```sh
    ./miniRT [scene_file]
```

## Bonus
